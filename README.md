Responsive view for mobile & larger screens

This website was created for an Estonian freelance graphic designer, Henri Kutsar.



**PROJECT VIEW**

The idea was to create a minimalistic, yet with a clean anad animated user interface. The project view can be seen by clicking on the grid.

The project view is designed and written by focusing on small details. On larger screen, an user can leave the view by clicking on specific parts of the overlay. 
Using the back button event, user can leave both on larger screen and on mobile. We discussed and reached to consensus that a clear indicator (e. an 'X' is too robust and oldschool in 2021).

**INFO & CONTACT MODAL**

Clickng on the navigation element opens an animated modal component. It is built with a CSS grid. 
Clicking on overlay below, the modal closes.
